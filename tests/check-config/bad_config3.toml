# These sections allows to customize how crater treats specific crates/repos

# The available options for each crate/repo are:
#  - skip            (bool): ignore this crate/repo
#  - skip-tests      (bool): don't run tests in this crate/repo
#  - quiet           (bool): don't kill after two minutes without output
#  - update-lockfile (bool): update the lockfile even if the crate has one
#  - broken          (bool): treat a Crater error on this crate/repo as a build
#                            failure (typically the crate is broken in an
#                            unusual way and we want to indicate the failure
#                            is 'permissible', while still building it if the
#                            failure is resolved in the future)
